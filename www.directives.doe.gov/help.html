<p>The links at the top of the page will take you to the major elements of the site--directives, delegations and requirements. The toolbar at right includes links to related resources. In order from the top are links to</p>
<ul>

<p>The Portal supports a variety of popular browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome). However, IE8.X users should note that the hyperlinks do not function in the document history details graphic (the Show All button under the History tab for a Directive). In other browsers, the graphic includes hyperlinks to the previous versions of the Directive. To find the version of IE that you are using, go to the Help menu and choose About Internet Explorer.<b></b></p>

<p>In the <a href="help/directives.html#c8-operator=or&amp;c10=&amp;c12=&amp;b_start=0">Directives</a> section select a collection where you wish to search.</p>
<h4 class="image-inline"><img class="image-inline" title="Search" src="dirimages/search.png/%40%40images/14e4a953-97da-4b19-84fa-c2523d621950.png" alt="Search" /> Search</h4>
<p><span>The search box is in the upper right corner anywhere on the site. Use quotation marks and the AND and OR operators to make your search more restrictive. When searching for a directive number omit the use of dashes in your search. Instead of a dash insert a space. Use advanced search when you have specific criteria.</span></p>
<h4><img class="image-inline" title="Advanced Search" src="dirimages/advanced-search/%40%40images/8e753f6b-e3c0-42fc-ad75-4a42f69b86ab.jpg" alt="Advanced Search" /> Advanced Search</h4>
<p><span>Click on </span>Advanced Search<span> when you have specifics for your inquiry:</span></p>
<p>You can narrow or expand your search based on the criteria you select from the options available.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a Document Status collection (current, archive or draft; or rescinded). You can choose more than one.</li>
<li>Select a Document Type. You can choose one or more document or delegation types.</li>
<li>The following are optional but will help to refine your search:
<ul>
<li>Enter text of interest (use AND/OR to combine multiple words).</li>
<li>Enter a document title.</li>
<li>Enter all or part of a document number (e.g., entering 251 would return documents in that series; DOE O 251.1C would return that directive).</li>
<li>Do not use dashes when you search by document number. Instead of a dash insert a space.</li>
<li>Select an office of primary interest (OPI) to find all documents produced by that organization. You can choose more than one.</li>
<li>Enter dates to limit your search to a specific time period.</li>
<li>Select whether you want to search for documents with a contractor requirements document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><img class="image-inline" title="Faceted Search" src="dirimages/facetedSearch.jpg/%40%40images/68b11ad9-75e6-4c05-a6c7-d5c2476a5094.jpg" alt="Faceted Search" /> Faceted Search</h4>
<p>Faceted search/navigation/browsing (at left of the document listing) allows you to set limits on the list that is being displayed. You will be "filtering" the list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose one or more of the Document Types (Order, Guide, Manual, Policy, Notice, Justification Memo, or Certification Memo). Everything not selected will be filtered out of the list.</li>
<li>You can select a directive number series. When you choose a series, the list includes only that number series.</li>
<li>Narrow your list by Issue Date within a specific time period.</li>
<li>You can narrow your search by choosing one or more Subjects.</li>
<li>Or you can limit the list to documents produced by a particular office (OPI).</li>
<li>You can include or exclude documents subject to Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board review or containing Contractor Requirements Documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you filter your search, you will see the list of documents change to accommodate your filters. You can remove some or all of the filters in the last box to revise or you can choose "Remove all".</p>

<h4 class="image-inline"><img class="image-inline" title="" src="dirimages/copy_of_icon_help.png/%40%40images/692f2648-7460-428d-a488-a7bf71a7a81b.png" alt="" /> Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<p><b>What are directives?</b></p>
<p>Directives are the primary means to establish, communicate, and institutionalize policies, requirements, responsibilities, and procedures for Departmental elements and contractors.</p>
<p><b>Why do we need directives?</b></p>
<p>Directives facilitate the achievement of the Department of Energy’s strategic and operational goals and help ensure safe, secure, efficient, cost-effective operations and compliance with applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p><b>What are the different types of directives?</b></p>
<p><b>Policies</b> establish high level expectations in the conduct of the Department’s mission impacting two or more Departmental elements. <br /><b>Orders</b> establish management objectives and requirements and assign responsibilities for DOE Federal employees consistent with policy and regulations. Requirements must be unique to DOE and must avoid duplicating information from other directives or any existing legal source.<br /><b>Notices</b> have the same effect as Orders but are issued in response to Departmental matters requiring prompt action to establish short-term management objectives.<br /><b>Manuals</b> supplement other directives, laws, and regulations, or other requirements by providing more instructions or details on how the provisions of these directives or laws must be carried out throughout DOE.<br /><b>Guides</b> provide acceptable, but not mandatory, means for complying with requirements of an Order or rule.</p>
<p><b>When is a directive in effect?</b></p>
<p>A directive is in effect after it has been approved by a person with signatory authority and published.</p>
<p><b>When is directive updated?</b></p>
<p>Directives must keep pace with statutes, regulations and organizational change and are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain current and relevant. Significant changes in statute or regulation may trigger directives review or revision.</p>
<p><b>Who owns a particular directive?</b></p>
<p>Offices of primary interest (OPIs) have been assigned for each individual directive. The OPI is the office under which lies the majority of interest or subject matter expertise.</p>
<p><b>Who should read directives?</b></p>
<p>Everybody should read and understand directives because they increase agency efficiency and protect you from harm and liability.</p>
<p><b>How do I know if a directive applies to me?</b></p>
<p>Your supervisor should be able to tell you if a particular directive applies to you.</p>
<p><b>How are new directives developed?</b></p>
<p>The OPI conducts an analysis and obtains approval for developing a draft directive document. The draft is reviewed by various offices and routed for formal approval. The directive is then implemented when published.</p>
<p><b>How do I know if I am using the most current version of a directive?</b></p>
<p>The most current version of a directive is available on the Directives listing for Current Directives. Archived directives are available for a historical perspective and are clearly marked as such. Be sure to check directives that you may have printed or saved to your computer to ensure that the version you have saved remains current.</p>
<p><b>If I need clarification on a directive, who should I contact?</b></p>
<p>Your supervisor should be able to assist you. You can also use the <a target="_self" class="internal-link" title="" href="help/contact-info.html">Contact Form</a>.</p>
<p><b>What should I do if I want to comment on a directive?</b></p>
<p>Your comments and input are welcome. There is a Feedback form at the bottom of each directive window.</p>
<p><b>If I have idea for a new directive or for changes or revisions to existing directives, who should I tell?</b></p>
<p>Each contractor, field office and Headquarters program office has an assigned <a href="help/dpc-resources/dpc-list.html">Directives Point of Contact</a> (DPC). You can tell your DPC. If the idea has merit, your idea can be elevated for potential implementation.</p>
<p><b>What is the relationship between directives and Technical Standards?</b></p>
<p>Some directives invoke technical standards as requirements. A technical standards crosswalk is available in References.</p>
<p><b>What is the DNFSB?</b></p>
<p>The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, an independent agency of the U.S. established in 1988 to oversees DOE's nuclear weapons complex. The DNFSB reviews the content and implementation of health and safety standards at DOE Defense Nuclear Facilities. The board also makes recommendations to the President and Secretary of Energy regarding health and safety issues at Defense Nuclear Facilities. Find a list of Directives of interest to the DNFSB is in DOE O 251.1C, Appendix C.</p>
<p><b>What is the Directives Review Board (DRB), what is its role in the Departmental Directives Program, and who are its members?</b></p>
<p><a class="internal-link" target="_self" title="" href="directives-documents/200-series/0251.html">DOE O 251.1C</a>, <i>Departmental Directives Program</i>, established the DRB to ensure that directives are consistent with Departmental standards and to add value to the Department's business processes and operations. <a class="internal-link" target="_self" title="" href="references/directives-review-board.html">DRB members</a> are: the Director, Office of Management (Chair), who represents the interests of MA and organizations not otherwise represented on the DRB; representatives of the Offices of the Under Secretaries of Energy, Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration; the Office of General Counsel; and the Office of Health, Safety and Security. Advisory members represent the National Laboratory Directors and the Field Management Council.</p>
<p><b>What is a Justification Memorandum (JM)?</b></p>
<p>A JM is a formal request for directive development, revision, cancellation or certification submitted to the DRB by the Office of Primary Interest (OPI). Each JM addresses purpose, justification and impact of the directive. The OPI submits the JM to the Directives Program, Office of Management (MA-1.2) and the DRB Liaison schedules it for discussion at an upcoming DRB meeting where it is expected that the OPI will present justification. The DRB reaches consensus on the proposed action.</p>
<p><b>How are directives series numbers determined?</b></p>
<p>Directives are numbered according to the topic addressed. Revised directives are numbered by adding letters to the numbers. For example, the first order that defined the Directives Program was DOE O 251.1. There have been three revisions to the current version which is <a class="internal-link" target="_self" title="" href="directives-documents/200-series/0251.html">DOE O 251.1C</a></p>
<p><b>What is the expected cycle time for developing a directive?</b></p>
<p>The directives process includes preparing the JM, developing the directive, review and comment, and approval of a final draft that is posted for informational purposes and approval by the DRB. The Deputy Secretary signs formal approval. Standard processing time is 150 days as shown in the table below. Note that directive development stops when the directive is sent to the DRB for final submission to the Deputy Secretary for approval. Extension to standard processing time must be approved by the DRB.<br /><br /> <b>Standard Schedule for Directives Development</b></p>

<p><b>How does an organization obtain an exemption from directive requirements?</b></p>
<p>If available, specific exemptions are listed in the directive along with a procedure for requesting exemption. See <a class="internal-link" target="_self" title="" href="directives-documents/200-series/0251.html">DOE O 251.1C</a>, Appendix E.</p>
<p><b>What is the difference between an equivalency and an exemption?</b></p>
<p>An equivalency is an approved alternative to how a requirement is met (applicable when the “how” is specified). An exemption is release from one or more requirements in a directive.</p>
<p><strong>When I open a document, how can I make it come up in a separate window?</strong></p>
<p>If you right click on your mouse, you will see options for opening the file or a PDF in a separate window.</p>
<p><b>Who should I contact when I have comments/questions on an approved directive?</b></p>
<p><span>Contact the writer via the Feedback mechanism. On the new portal, select Directives -&gt; Current and choose the directive of interest. The Feedback option is at the bottom of the page.</span></p>
<p><strong>Where does my feedback go?</strong></p>
<p><span>Feedback goes to the writer and site administrator for review. Approved feedback will be published with the document.<br /></span></p>
<p><b>Certain directives have expired. Are they still in effect?</b></p>
<p>Yes, with the exception of Notices, which expire one year after the approval date. Expiration dates, which are no longer in use, were at one time reminders for issuing organizations to review their directives.</p>
<p><b>If my directive is 4 or more years old and still current and relevant, how do I get it certified?</b></p>
<p>In the <a class="internal-link" target="_self" title="" href="development-and-review-of-directives.html">Directives Tools</a> link on the new portal, you will find a template for a Certification Letter that includes instructions. Complete the process defined in the template, and submit a hard copy to the Directives Program, Office of Management in room 1G-051. MA-1.2 will send your Certification Letter to the DRB for consideration.</p>
<p><b>I've been asked to review a document in RevCom. What is my next step?</b></p>

<p><b>I need an alternate or backup to serve as coordinator for me at times when I am unavailable. Should I assign a delegate?</b></p>
<p>Delegates assist DPCs in user assignment and comment coordination. Normally, the work of the Delegate should be reviewed by the DPC prior to submitting the final comments package; however, RevCom provides the option to automatically submit the Delegate's work when the comments are due. To activate this feature, <a target="_self" class="internal-link" title="" href="help/contact-info.html">contact Technical Support</a> or call 505-663-1302.</p>
<p><b>I need a report with all of the comments from my organization for my supervisor to approve prior to my final submission. Where do I find that?</b></p>
<p>Once a DPC has selected a set of comments for inclusion in the organization's comment package, a "My Organization Comments" is available. This is the ideal report for supervisor approval.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you are in the document, choose Reports&gt;Quick&gt;My Organization Comments.</li>
<li>You can display the report onscreen or in an Excel file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, DOE contractors may submit comments via RevCom through their Directives Points of Contact. (See <span><a href="help/dpc-resources/dpc-list.html">DPC listing</a></span>).</p>
<p><b>If a directive does not apply to my organization, do we have to submit comments?</b></p>
<p>No. However, you should register your participation in RevCom by clicking on the "Submit" button in the top left portion of your RevCom screen then choose the "No Comments" option.</p>
<p><b>How do I get an extension on my due date?</b></p>
<p>A due date extension is granted only for special or rare circumstances. SMEs/reviewers should contact their local DPCs for extensions; DPCs should contact the Directives management team using the <a target="_self" class="internal-link" title="" href="help/contact-info.html">Contact Form</a> or call RevCom Technical Support at 505-663-1302.</p>
<p><b>Explain the difference between an "Activity" and a "Document" and explain how they relate to review and response and other phases.</b></p>
<p>The "document" is the draft directive that is being reviewed. RevCom breaks up the workflow for a document into different activities or phases; for example, Review and Comment, Comment Response, etc. The "activity" (phase) name follows the document title after the last comma. (Doc ID, Doc Title, <b>Activity Name</b>) Each activity or phase has its own reporting options, but all activities within the same workflow (document) share reference materials. This is important to know if you are working on a concurrence, for example, and want to see the comments and responses from the "Review and Comment" phase. In this case you need to actually find the "Review and Comment" activity in the document list on your primary RevCom screen (usually under "Review Completed"). In the Reports menu, choose Custom and in the form that follows make the following selections.</p>
<ol>
<li>Both</li>
<li>Top Organizations (or the top level organization in your org chain for all accepted comments within your org only)</li>
<li>None</li>
<li>No</li>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>All Paragraphs (or preference)</li>
<li>No (or preference)</li>
</ol>
<p>Use the <span><a target="_self" class="internal-link" title="" href="help/contact-info.html">Contact Form</a></span> or call RevCom Technical Support at 505-663-1302, if you need assistance.</p>
<p><b>How do I find/Print a comment response report?</b></p>
<p>In the Document List, select the document in its "Review and Comment" activity (usually under "Review Completed"). In the Reports Menu, select Custom and in the form that follows, select the following options and print the report:</p>
<ol>
<li>Both</li>
<li>Top Organizations (or the top level organization in your org chain for all accepted comments within your org only)</li>
<li>None</li>
<li>No</li>
<li>Yes</li>
