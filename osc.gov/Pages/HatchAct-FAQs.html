Although the Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from being candidates in
partisan elections, it does not prohibit them from holding partisan elective
office. Thus, if an individual holds elected office when he becomes employed by
the federal government, he may serve out the remainder of his term. Likewise, a
federal employee may be appointed to fill a vacancy in a partisan elective
office. In both of these situations, however, the federal employee may not seek
to retain the position by way of a partisan election.​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>What is a partisan political group or organization?

political groups or organizations” are committees, clubs, and other
organizations that affiliate with a political party or candidate for political
office in a partisan election. The term also includes committees, clubs, and
other organizations that are organized for a partisan political purpose. 501(c)(4) organizations are organized to promote social welfare and may participate in some political activity on behalf of or in opposition to candidates for public office, provided such activity is not their primary activity. In light of their purpose, OSC has concluded that they are not partisan political groups for purposes of the Hatch Act.</p><p>However, because 501(c)(4) organizations may participate in some political activity, employees should be cautious about engaging in any 501(c)(4)-related activity while at work.&#160;For example, the Hatch Act would prohibit an employee from forwarding an email from a 501(c)(4) organization if that email advocates for or against a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group.</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>Can I be appointed to partisan political office?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClass1A21A5209A1B49F69FB82240B660B52D"><p>​Yes.
Federal employees may be appointed to a partisan political office. Although the
Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from being candidates in partisan
elections, it does not prohibit them from holding partisan elective office.
Thus, the Hatch Act does not prohibit a federal employee from being appointed
to a partisan elective office. The federal employee, however, may not seek to
retain the position by way of a partisan election without first resigning from
federal employment. ​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>Can I put a campaign sign in my front yard?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClass928951AECE71436194D1A9C7E81E1225"><p><strong>Less Restricted Employees&#58;</strong> Yes.

The Hatch Act applies to federal civilian employees so long as they are employed by an executive branch agency.

Because an employee is not on duty while they are on leave, this prohibition would not apply. However, while on leave, the employee remains subject to the other prohibitions in the Hatch Act. Thus, an employee on leave is still prohibited from engaging in political activity while in a government building, wearing an official uniform or insignia, or using a government vehicle. § 7324. Moreover, while the Act permits <em>less restricted</em> employees to actively participate in partisan political management and partisan political campaigns, those employees are nevertheless prohibited, at all times, from using their official authority or influence for the purpose of affecting the result of an election; knowingly soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions from any person; being candidates for public office in partisan elections; and knowingly soliciting or discouraging the political activity of any individual with business before the employee's agency. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7323">§ 7323(a)(1)-(4)​</a>. </p><p>Thus, while the Hatch Act does not prohibit a <em>less restricted</em> employee from taking leave to volunteer for a partisan political campaign, the employee is still prohibited from, among other things, soliciting, accepting or receiving political contributions while they are on leave. </p><p><strong>Further Restricted Employees&#58;</strong> Yes. The guidelines set forth above, for <em>less restricted</em> employees, apply,&#160;but with an added limitation. Unlike <em>less restricted</em> employees, the Hatch Act prohibits <em>further restricted</em> employees from taking an active part in partisan political management and partisan political campaigns. This means <em>further restricted</em> employees may not, at any time, engage in political activity on behalf of or in concert with a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan public office. For instance, taking an &quot;active part&quot; would include&#58; distributing material created by a partisan candidate, political party, or partisan political group; speaking at a political rally organized or sponsored by such entities; or serving as a campaign volunteer. It also would include engaging in political activity through a medium sponsored or controlled by a political party, partisan political group, or partisan candidate, such as by endorsing a candidate in a commercial sponsored by one of these entities. </p><p>Thus, the Hatch Act prohibits a <em>further restricted</em> employee from volunteering for a partisan political campaign even if the employee is on leave. ​​​​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>Can I serve as a treasurer for a political action committee (PAC) or as the treasurer for someone’s campaign?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClassCFA96DA71981479796352E8C2E6FC930"><p><strong>Less Restricted Employees&#58;</strong> It depends.

Inviting subordinate employees to a political fundraiser would violate at least
two provisions of the Hatch Act. First, inviting other individuals to a
political fundraiser would violate the Act’s prohibition against soliciting, accepting,
or receiving political contributions, even if the supervisory employee does not
expressly ask the individuals to contribute money. Second, inviting subordinate
employees to any political event would violate the Act’s prohibition against
using one’s official authority or influence to affect the result of an
election. Such conduct is inherently coercive, and violates the Act even if the
supervisory employee does not threaten to penalize subordinates who do not
attend or promise to reward those who do attend. Finally, inviting subordinates

The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from soliciting, accepting or
receiving political contributions. A political contribution is defined as any
gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value,
made for the purpose of promoting or opposing a political party, candidate for
partisan political office, or partisan political group. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/734.101">5 C.F.R. § 734.101​</a>. The
purpose of the luncheon is to promote a candidate who is running for partisan
political office. Accordingly, contributions made to help cover the costs of
the luncheon constitute political contributions for purposes of the Hatch Act.
Because the Hatch Act prohibits employees from soliciting or accepting
political contributions, the Act would prohibit a federal employee from
soliciting or accepting contributions to help pay for the cost of the luncheon.​​​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>May an employee solicit and accept contributions to help pay for the costs of attending a political party convention as a delegate?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClass6143A1E1A9164B05A9B2848DC7484AC8"><p><strong>Less Restricted employees&#58;</strong> No. The Hatch Act prohibits employees from soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions.

The purpose of being a delegate to a party's convention is to vote for and support a particular candidate as the nominee of that party. Accordingly, contributions made to a delegate to help cover the costs of attending the national convention constitute political contributions for purposes of the Hatch Act.

connection with an activity financed in whole or in part by federal funds. <em>Special
Counsel</em> v. <em>Gallagher</em>, 44 M.S.P.R. 57, 61 (1990). If an employee meets this

The Hatch Act applies to employees of private, nonprofit organizations only if
the statutes through which these organizations derive their federal funding
contain a provision stating that the recipient organizations are deemed to be
state, D.C. or local government agencies for purposes of the Hatch Act. To date, the
statutes authorizing Head Start and Community Service Block Grant (CSBG)
are the only statutes that contain such a provision. Accordingly, covered
employees are those individuals at private nonprofit organizations who perform
duties “in connection with” programs financed in whole or in part by Head Start
or CSBG funds.​​​​​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>If I am covered by the Hatch Act, will taking a sabbatical or leave of absence allow me to be a candidate in a partisan election?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClassA66F040AFA76416392A57330BD3C63F6"><p>No.

While elected officials are exempt from the candidacy prohibition of the Hatch
Act, they are still subject to the other two prohibitions – the prohibitions
against using one’s official authority to affect the result of an election and
directly or indirectly coercing a state, D.C. or local employee to make a political
contribution. Because it is inherently coercive for a supervisor to ask a
subordinate employee to contribute to a political cause, the Hatch Act would
prohibit an elected official form asking subordinate employees to help or
contribute to his reelection campaign.​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>I am a Hatch Act covered employee and a supervisor; can I ask my staff to volunteer for the governor’s campaign, or the campaign for any other elected official?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClassA9C4EE93E443499F94EA9C9093F38746"><p>No.
As discussed above, it is inherently coercive for a
supervisor to ask a subordinate employee to contribute to a political cause.
Therefore, the Hatch Act would prohibit a supervisor from asking subordinates
to volunteer for any partisan political campaign, political party, etc.​​​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>I am a Hatch Act covered employee and a supervisor.

Inviting subordinate employees to a political fundraiser would violate two
provisions of the Hatch Act. First, inviting subordinate state or local
employees to a political fundraiser would violate the Act’s prohibition against
directly or indirectly coercing, attempting to coerce, or advising other
employees to make a political contribution, even if the supervisory employee
does not expressly ask the individuals to contribute money. Second, inviting
subordinate employees to any political event would violate the Act’s
prohibition against using one’s official influence or authority to affect the
result of an election. Such conduct is inherently coercive, and violates the
Act even if the supervisory employee does not threaten to penalize subordinates
who do not attend or promise to reward those who do attend. ​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>A Hatch Act complaint has been filed against me, can I find out who filed it?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClass2CC43A891DA54642A45D6064AFC78715"><p>As a general matter, OSC staff may not disclose the name of the person who filed a Hatch Act complaint.
