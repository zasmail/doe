<p> All civilian employees in the executive branch of the federal government, except the President and the Vice President, are covered by the provisions of the Hatch Act. Employees of the U. S. Postal Service&#160;are also covered by the Act. Part-time employees are covered by the Act. Federal and District of Columbia employees subject to the Hatch Act continue to be covered while on annual leave, sick leave, leave without pay, or furlough. However, employees who work on an occasional or irregular basis, or who are special government employees, as defined in title 18 U. S.C. § 202(a), are subject to the restrictions only when they are engaged in government business. Federal employees fall within two categories under the Hatch Act, Further Restricted and Less Restricted. </p>

employees: </p>
<ul class="strong italic">
   <li>May not be a candidate for nomination or election to public office in a 
	partisan election.</li>
   <li>May not take an active part in partisan political campaigns. For example:

         <li>May not use their official titles or positions while engaged in 
			political activity.</li>
         <li>May not invite subordinate employees to political events or 
			otherwise suggest to subordinates that they attend political events

      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>May not solicit, accept or receive a donation or contribution for a

         <li>May not wear or display partisan political buttons, T-shirts, 
			signs, or other items.</li>
         <li>May not make political contributions to a partisan political party,

			partisan political office, or partisan political group.</li>
         <li>May not use any e-mail account or social media to distribute, send 
			or forward content that advocates for or against a partisan 
			political party, candidate for partisan political office, or 
			partisan political group.</li>
      </ul> 
   </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="permittedactivities">Permitted Activities</h2>
<p> As discussed, further restricted federal employees are prohibited from 
taking an active part in partisan political management or partisan political 
campaigns. Specifically, these employees may not campaign for or against

party, a candidate for partisan political office, or a partisan political group. 
However, such employees, for example: </p>
<ul class="strong italic">

   <li>May assist in nonpartisan voter registration drives.</li>
   <li>May participate in campaigns where none of the candidates represent a

   <li>May be a candidate for public office in a nonpartisan election.</li>
   <li>May express opinions about candidates and issues. If the expression is 
	political activity, however – i.e., activity directed at the success or

	Hatch Act by federal employees. The changes became effective on January 27, 
	2013. Under the modified penalty structure, an employee who violates the 
	Hatch Act is subject to a range of disciplinary actions. This includes 
	removal from federal service, reduction in grade, debarment from federal 
	employment for a period not to exceed 5 years, suspension, reprimand, or a 
	civil penalty not to exceed $1,000. (Before enactment of these amendments, 
	an employee was subject to removal, or in some cases, a suspension of no 
	less than 30 days for Hatch Act violations). The modified penalty structure 
	applies to violations that occurred before, on, or after January 27, 2013, 
	unless OSC has already initiated a complaint with the Merit Systems 
	Protection Board as of that date, or an employee has already entered into a 
	settlement agreement with OSC.</p>

elector received votes in the last preceding election at which Presidential
electors were selected, but does not include any office or position within a
political party or affiliated organization. Examples of political parties that
received votes in the last Presidential election are the Democratic,
Republican, Libertarian, and Green Parties. Thus, a partisan election is one in
which any candidate is to be nominated or elected as representing a political

political party and the others do not.</p><p>  The prohibition against being a candidate in a
partisan election does not include running for an office or position within a

Although the Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from being candidates in
partisan elections, it does not prohibit them from holding partisan elective
office. Thus, if an individual holds elected office when he becomes employed by
the federal government, he may serve out the remainder of his term. Likewise, a
federal employee may be appointed to fill a vacancy in a partisan elective
office. In both of these situations, however, the federal employee may not seek
to retain the position by way of a partisan election.​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>What is a partisan political group or organization?

political groups or organizations” are committees, clubs, and other
organizations that affiliate with a political party or candidate for political
office in a partisan election. The term also includes committees, clubs, and
other organizations that are organized for a partisan political purpose. 501(c)(4) organizations are organized to promote social welfare and may participate in some political activity on behalf of or in opposition to candidates for public office, provided such activity is not their primary activity. In light of their purpose, OSC has concluded that they are not partisan political groups for purposes of the Hatch Act.</p><p>However, because 501(c)(4) organizations may participate in some political activity, employees should be cautious about engaging in any 501(c)(4)-related activity while at work.&#160;For example, the Hatch Act would prohibit an employee from forwarding an email from a 501(c)(4) organization if that email advocates for or against a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group.</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>Can I be appointed to partisan political office?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClass1A21A5209A1B49F69FB82240B660B52D"><p>​Yes.
Federal employees may be appointed to a partisan political office. Although the
Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from being candidates in partisan
elections, it does not prohibit them from holding partisan elective office.
Thus, the Hatch Act does not prohibit a federal employee from being appointed
to a partisan elective office. The federal employee, however, may not seek to
retain the position by way of a partisan election without first resigning from
federal employment. ​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>Can I put a campaign sign in my front yard?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClass928951AECE71436194D1A9C7E81E1225"><p><strong>Less Restricted Employees&#58;</strong> Yes.

The Hatch Act applies to federal civilian employees so long as they are employed by an executive branch agency.

Because an employee is not on duty while they are on leave, this prohibition would not apply. However, while on leave, the employee remains subject to the other prohibitions in the Hatch Act. Thus, an employee on leave is still prohibited from engaging in political activity while in a government building, wearing an official uniform or insignia, or using a government vehicle. § 7324. Moreover, while the Act permits <em>less restricted</em> employees to actively participate in partisan political management and partisan political campaigns, those employees are nevertheless prohibited, at all times, from using their official authority or influence for the purpose of affecting the result of an election; knowingly soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions from any person; being candidates for public office in partisan elections; and knowingly soliciting or discouraging the political activity of any individual with business before the employee's agency. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7323">§ 7323(a)(1)-(4)​</a>. </p><p>Thus, while the Hatch Act does not prohibit a <em>less restricted</em> employee from taking leave to volunteer for a partisan political campaign, the employee is still prohibited from, among other things, soliciting, accepting or receiving political contributions while they are on leave. </p><p><strong>Further Restricted Employees&#58;</strong> Yes. The guidelines set forth above, for <em>less restricted</em> employees, apply,&#160;but with an added limitation. Unlike <em>less restricted</em> employees, the Hatch Act prohibits <em>further restricted</em> employees from taking an active part in partisan political management and partisan political campaigns. This means <em>further restricted</em> employees may not, at any time, engage in political activity on behalf of or in concert with a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan public office. For instance, taking an &quot;active part&quot; would include&#58; distributing material created by a partisan candidate, political party, or partisan political group; speaking at a political rally organized or sponsored by such entities; or serving as a campaign volunteer. It also would include engaging in political activity through a medium sponsored or controlled by a political party, partisan political group, or partisan candidate, such as by endorsing a candidate in a commercial sponsored by one of these entities. </p><p>Thus, the Hatch Act prohibits a <em>further restricted</em> employee from volunteering for a partisan political campaign even if the employee is on leave. ​​​​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>Can I serve as a treasurer for a political action committee (PAC) or as the treasurer for someone’s campaign?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClassCFA96DA71981479796352E8C2E6FC930"><p><strong>Less Restricted Employees&#58;</strong> It depends.

For example, an employee serving as the treasurer of a partisan political campaign may not allow his name to appear anywhere on a letter soliciting political contributions for an organization, party, or candidate, including in the letterhead of such a letter. Some states require the campaign treasurer's name to appear on all campaign materials, including solicitations.

supervisory employee does not threaten to penalize subordinates who do not
attend or promise to reward those who do attend. Finally, inviting subordinates

An employee is allowed to park his or her privately owned vehicle with a bumper

bumper sticker in a private lot or garage for which the employee receives a
subsidy from his or her agency.​​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>Will I violate the Hatch Act if I listen to radio programs discussing partisan politics or candidates for partisan political office, or read a book about politics or political candidates while I am in the federal workplace?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClassFEB4DFA745B5406CAD120346C8D9580A"><p>No.
Some federal agencies allow employees to listen to the radio while they are at
work. Merely listening to a radio program that is discussing politics while in
the federal workplace, without more, is not a Hatch Act violation. Similarly,
merely reading a book about politics or political candidates while in the
federal workplace, without more, is not a Hatch Act violation. However,
employees should make certain that the federal agency where they work does not
have any internal policies prohibiting its employees from generally engaging in
any of these activities while at work&#160;(i.e., listening to the radio, reading).​​​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>Is it a Hatch Act violation for a federal agency to have televisions in the federal workplace that are tuned to stations such as Fox News or MSNBC?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClassE64B3338460E43C5B2A61BD30A6B9877"><p>No.
Watching, or allowing the broadcast of, stations such as Fox News or MSNBC in
the federal workplace, without more, does not violate the Hatch Act. Thus,
while some federal agencies may have televisions located in lobbies or other
public areas within a federal workplace that are tuned to such stations the
Hatch Act does not prohibit them from doing so.​​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>Can a federal employee display in his office a photograph of his spouse or child even if the spouse or child is a candidate in an election for partisan political office?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClass303E70396D71465BB4FB69F55191CD18"><p>Yes.

supervisor from soliciting a subordinate employee to write a policy speech for
the supervisor to give at a partisan political event. In addition, the Act

   <h2>Who Is Cov​ered</h2> 
    
   <p>The following list offers examples of the types of programs which 
	frequently receive financial assistance from the federal government: public 
	health, public welfare, housing, urban renewal and area redevelopment, 
	employment security, labor and industry training, public works, 
	conservation, agricultural, civil defense, transportation, anti-poverty, and 
	law enforcement programs. </p> 
   <p>Hatch Act provisions also apply to employees of private, nonprofit 
	organizations that plan, develop and coordinate federal Head Start or 
	Community Service Block Grant programs.</p> 
   <p>State, D.C.,&#160;or local employees subject to the Hatch Act continue to be 
	covered while on annual leave, sick leave, leave without pay, administrative 
	leave or furlough.</p> 
   <h2>Who Is Not Covered</h2> 
   <p>Hatch Act provisions do not apply to:</p> 
   <ol class="strong" type="I"> 
      <li>individuals who exercise no functions in connection with federally 
		financed activities; or</li> 
      <li>individuals employed by educational or research institutions, 
		establishments, or agencies which are supported in whole or in part by 
		state or political subdivisions thereof, the District of Columbia, or by 
		recognized religious, philanthropic or cultural organizations (e.g., 
		administrators, teachers).</li> 
   </ol> 
   <p>The law also exempts certain specified employees from the prohibition on 
	candidacy for elective office. These exemptions include:</p> 
   <ol class="strong" type="I"> 
      <li>the governor or lieutenant governor of a state, or an individual 
		authorized by law to act as governor;</li> 
      <li>the mayor of a city;</li> 
      <li>a duly elected head of an executive department of a state or 
		municipality who is not classified under a state or municipal merit or 
		civil service system; and</li> 
      <li>an individual holding public elective office. This exemption applies 
		only when the elective office is the position which would otherwise 
		subject the employee to the restriction of the Hatch Act.</li> 
   </ol>
   <h2>Political Activities and Examples of Prohibited Activities</h2> 
   <p>Covered state, District of Columbia&#160;and local employees may not:</p> 
   <ul class="strong"> 
      <li>	be candidates for public office in a partisan election; *</li> 
      <li>	use official authority or influence to interfere with or affect the 
		results of an election or nomination; or</li> 
      <li>	directly or indirectly coerce, attempt to coerce, command, or advise 
		a state, D.C.,&#160;or local officer or employee to pay, lend, or contribute 
		anything of value to a party, committee, organization, agency, or person 
		for political purposes.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>State, District of Columbia or local employees subject to the Hatch Act 
	should note that an election is partisan if any candidate is to be nominated 
	or elected as representing a political party, for example, the Democratic or 
	Republican Party.</p> 
   <p>A note of caution - an employee’s conduct is also subject to the laws of 
	the state and the regulations of the employing agency. Prohibitions of the 
	Hatch Act are not affected by state, D.C.,&#160;or local laws. </p> 
   <p>*On December 19, 2012, Congress passed the Hatch Act Modernization Act of 
	2012 (the Act). The Act became effective on January 27, 2013. Now, only 
	state, D.C.,&#160;or local government employees whose salaries are paid for 
	entirely by federal funds&#160;are prohibited from running for partisan office. 
	All other state, D.C.,&#160;and local employees, even if they are otherwise 
	covered by Hatch Act restrictions&#160;are free under the Hatch Act&#160;to run for 
	partisan office.</p> 
   <h2>Examples of Permitted Activities</h2> 
   <p>Employees may**, for example:</p>
   <ul class="strong"> 
      <li>register and vote as they choose</li> 
      <li>assist in voter registration drives</li> 
      <li>express opinions about candidates and issues</li> 
      <li>contribute money to political organizations</li> 
      <li>attend political fundraising functions</li> 
      <li>attend and be active at political rallies and meetings</li> 
      <li>join and be active members of a political party or club</li> 
      <li>sign and circulate nominating petitions</li> 
      <li>campaign for or against referendum questions, constitutional 
		amendments and/or municipal ordinances</li> 
      <li>campaign for or against candidates in partisan elections</li> 
      <li>make campaign speeches for candidates in partisan elections</li> 
      <li>distribute campaign literature in partisan elections</li> 
      <li>campaign for and hold office in political clubs or parties</li> 
      <li>volunteer to work on a partisan political campaign</li> 
      <li>participate in any activity not specifically prohibited by law or 
		regulation</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>**While engaging in these activities employees must be acting in their 
	personal capacity, not their official capacity. For example, they should not 
	identify their official title when engaging in any of these activities.</p> 
   <p>A note of caution—an employee’s conduct is also subject to the laws of the 
	state and the regulations of the employing agency. Prohibitions of the Hatch 
	Act are not affected by state, D.C.,&#160;or local laws.​</p>

The Hatch Act applies to employees of private, nonprofit organizations only if
the statutes through which these organizations derive their federal funding
contain a provision stating that the recipient organizations are deemed to be
state, D.C. or local government agencies for purposes of the Hatch Act. To date, the
statutes authorizing Head Start and Community Service Block Grant (CSBG)
are the only statutes that contain such a provision. Accordingly, covered
employees are those individuals at private nonprofit organizations who perform
duties “in connection with” programs financed in whole or in part by Head Start
or CSBG funds.​​​​​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>If I am covered by the Hatch Act, will taking a sabbatical or leave of absence allow me to be a candidate in a partisan election?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClassA66F040AFA76416392A57330BD3C63F6"><p>No.
If you are covered by the Hatch Act, taking a sabbatical or leave of absence

While elected officials are exempt from the candidacy prohibition of the Hatch
Act, they are still subject to the other two prohibitions – the prohibitions
against using one’s official authority to affect the result of an election and
directly or indirectly coercing a state, D.C. or local employee to make a political
contribution. Because it is inherently coercive for a supervisor to ask a
subordinate employee to contribute to a political cause, the Hatch Act would
prohibit an elected official form asking subordinate employees to help or
contribute to his reelection campaign.​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>I am a Hatch Act covered employee and a supervisor; can I ask my staff to volunteer for the governor’s campaign, or the campaign for any other elected official?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClassA9C4EE93E443499F94EA9C9093F38746"><p>No.
As discussed above, it is inherently coercive for a
supervisor to ask a subordinate employee to contribute to a political cause.
Therefore, the Hatch Act would prohibit a supervisor from asking subordinates
to volunteer for any partisan political campaign, political party, etc.​​​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>I am a Hatch Act covered employee and a supervisor.

Inviting subordinate employees to a political fundraiser would violate two
provisions of the Hatch Act. First, inviting subordinate state or local
employees to a political fundraiser would violate the Act’s prohibition against
directly or indirectly coercing, attempting to coerce, or advising other
employees to make a political contribution, even if the supervisory employee
does not expressly ask the individuals to contribute money. Second, inviting
subordinate employees to any political event would violate the Act’s
prohibition against using one’s official influence or authority to affect the
result of an election. Such conduct is inherently coercive, and violates the
Act even if the supervisory employee does not threaten to penalize subordinates
who do not attend or promise to reward those who do attend. ​</p></div></div></div><div class="custom-Accordion-FAQ"><div class="custom-AccordionHeader clearfix"><h1><span>Q:</span>A Hatch Act complaint has been filed against me, can I find out who filed it?</h1><a href="#" class="customAccordionToggle"></a></div><div class="custom-AccordionContent"><div class="mark">A:</div><div class="ExternalClass2CC43A891DA54642A45D6064AFC78715"><p>As a general matter, OSC staff may not disclose the name of the person who filed a Hatch Act complaint.

<h2>Congress Allows Most State and Local Public Employees to Run for Partisan 
Office</h2>
<p>On December 19, 2012, Congress passed the Hatch Act Modernization Act of 
2012. The Act allows most state and local government employees to run for 
partisan political office. Prior to this change, state and local government 
employees were prohibited from running for partisan office if they worked in 
connection with programs financed in whole or in part by federal loans or 
grants. With the change, the federal Hatch Act no longer prohibits state and 
local government employees from running for partisan office unless the 
employee’s salary is paid for completely by federal loans or grants.</p>
<p class="strong">This change will allow hundreds of thousands of state and 
local government employees to participate more actively in the democratic 
process in their communities.</p>
<p>Before entering a race as a candidate, employees should keep in mind the 
following:</p>
<ul class="strong">
   <li>Make sure your salary is not completely funded by federal loans or 
	grants. A very small number of state and local employees may continue to be 
	prohibited from running for office by the federal Hatch Act. Before running 
	for office, take steps to determine that your salary is not entirely -- 100% 
	-- funded by federal loans or grants. Your state, D.C., or local finance 
	office should be able to clarify whether your salary is completely funded by 
	federal loans or grants.</li>
   <li>Make sure state, D.C., or local law does not prohibit you from running. 
	Employees should also make sure that they are not prohibited from running 
	for office by state, D.C., or local law. Nearly every state, many 
	localities, and the District of Columbia have ethics rules that govern the 
	political activity of their employees. This includes, in some cases, the 
	ability of employees to run for state, D.C., or local office. While the 
	rules under the federal Hatch Act have been relaxed with regard to partisan 
	candidacies, states and localities are free to implement more rigid 
	requirements at their discretion. OSC does not keep a comprehensive list of 
	state and local political activity laws, and OSC does not enforce laws 
	passed at the state, D.C., or local level. Your state, D.C., or local ethics 
	office should be able to clarify whether any provision of state, D.C., or 
	local law prohibits you from running for office.</li>
   <li>The Hatch Act restricts state, D.c., or local employees from engaging in 
	political misconduct. The Hatch Act Modernization Act did not change the 
	federal Hatch Act’s prohibitions on coercive conduct or misuse of official 
	authority for partisan purposes. A state, D.C., or local employee is still 
	covered by these prohibitions if the employee works in connection with a 
	program financed in whole or in part by federal loans or grants, even if the 
	connection is relatively minor. A covered employee who runs for office would 
	violate the Hatch Act if the employee: 
      <ul>
         <li>uses federal or any other public funds to support his own 
			candidacy;</li>
         <li>uses his state, D.C., or local office to support his candidacy, 
			including by using official email, stationery, office supplies, or 
			other equipment or resources; or</li>
         <li>asks subordinates to volunteer for his campaign or contribute to 
			the campaign.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>

please call (800) 85-HATCH or (800) 854-2824, or write to
